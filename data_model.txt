To implement the described Redis database schema where you manage user details, associated products, and individual product details, here are the Redis commands to set up and manipulate your data according to your specifications. This schema involves using Redis hashes for storing user and product details, and lists for maintaining references to product IDs associated with each user.

### Creating and Managing User Details

1. **Creating a New User**:
   - **Key**: `user:{email}`
   - **Hash Values**: `password`, `name`, and `product_list` which points to another key for the product IDs list.

Here's how to create a user entry where `product_list` is initialized to point to an empty list key:

```bash
HSET user:john.doe@example.com password hashed_password_here name "John Doe" productList user:john.doe@example.com:products
```

2. **Initialize the Product List**:
   - When you create a user, you need to ensure that the product list key exists even if it is empty initially. This can be done using the `LPUSH` command followed by an immediate `LPOP` to ensure the list exists but is empty.

```bash
LPUSH user:john.doe@example.com:products "initialize"
LPOP user:john.doe@example.com:products
```

### Managing Product Details

1. **Adding a New Product**:
   - **Key**: `product:{productId}`
   - **Hash Values**: `name`, `brand`, `url`, and `image_url`.

Hereâ€™s the command to create a product entry:

```bash
HSET product:101 name "Example Product" brand "Example Brand" url "http://example.com/product" image_url "http://example.com/image.jpg"
```

2. **Linking a Product to a User**:
   - Add the product ID to the user's product list. You only need to use the `RPUSH` command if preserving the order of addition is necessary, or `SADD` if you simply need to manage a collection without duplicates and without regard to order.

```bash
RPUSH user:john.doe@example.com:products 101
```

### Retrieving Data

1. **Retrieve User Details**:
   - Get all details of a user, including the reference to their product list.

```bash
HGETALL user:john.doe@example.com
```

2. **Retrieve All Product IDs for a User**:
   - Fetch all product IDs associated with a user.

```bash
LRANGE user:john.doe@example.com:products 0 -1
```

3. **Retrieve Product Details**:
   - Fetch details of a specific product.

```bash
HGETALL product:101
```

### Considerations and Suggestions

- **Security**: Ensure that passwords stored in the Redis database are hashed using a secure cryptographic hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- **Data Integrity**: Regularly check that all references (like `productList` keys) are valid and do not point to non-existent keys.
- **Performance**: Redis is highly performant with these operations, but always monitor the size and scalability needs as user base and product listings grow.
- **Maintenance**: Be prepared to handle key deletions and clean-ups where necessary (e.g., removing a product ID from all user lists if the product is deleted).

This setup efficiently uses Redis' capabilities to manage user and product data in a scalable and performance-oriented manner.
