When creating a user creates a post,
The image that they submit should be placed in this folder.

This folder serves as a storage space for images because typically,
we do not save binary data like images in our database.

The naming convention of an image should be:
<user_id>_<product_id>.jpeg
e.g. 123_456.jpeg

The file path should be saved to the database.
i.e. /productimages/<user_id>_<product_id>.jpeg
